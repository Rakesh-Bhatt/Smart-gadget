This device was also on the run to become the new Google Pixel 2 XLâ€™s design. The HTC U11+ has a 6-inch Super LCD display with 18:9 aspect ratio and 1440 x 2880 pixels of resolution. This display is protected by Corning Gorilla Glass 5. In terms of the hardware, the U11+ is powered by an Octa-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 processor and 6 or 4 GB of RAM. As for the GPU, HTC has included Adreno 540 in the device. The 64 GB storage variant has 4 GB of RAM while the 128 GB variant comes with 6 GB of RAM.\r\n\r\nThe HTC U11+ runs on the latest and greatest from Google â€“ Android v8.0 Oreo. It supports memory expansion via a microSD card slot. The device has a rear-mounted fingerprint scanner engraved in the shiny glass back. It has a relatively big 3,930 mAh battery which, according to the manufacturer, can provide up to 25 hours of talk time on 3G. This battery is paired with Qualcomm Quick Charge 3.0.\r\nIn terms of the camera, the HTC U11+ has a 12-megapixel rear-facing camera with f/1.7 aperture, OIS and dual tone LED flash. At the front sits an 8-megapixel front-facing camera with f/2.0 aperture. It is a bummer that HTC didnâ€™t opt for dual camera lenses on the back. With the HTC U11+ comes a 30 percent louder bottom firing speaker which is also an upgrade from its predecessor â€“ the HTC U11. This device is now IP68 certified meaning the device is more resistant to water and dust than the U11.\r\n\r\nThe HTC U11+ carries a price tag of Â£699.

This device is for the people who want the U11 but on a budget. It is priced at $349 and its sales start today in the international market. The U11 Life shares the same design with its big brother. There is a glossy glass on the back with an aluminum frame bringing the display and the rear portion together. It has a 5.2-inch full HD Super LCD display with the traditional 16:9 aspect ratio. It is IP67 certified.\r\nUnder the hood, the HTC U11 Life comes with an Octa-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 630 processor with 2.2 GHz of clock speed. This processor is aided by 4 or 3 GB of RAM and Adreno 508 GPU. The 32 GB and 64 GB storage variant have 3 and 4 GB of RAM respectively. In terms of software, the HTC U11 Life will run on Android 7.1.1 Nougat out of the box with HTC Sense UI on top. Elsewhere, it will come with Android v8.0 Oreo right off the box and will function as Googleâ€™s Android One smartphone.\r\n\r\nThe device has 16-megapixel primary and secondary cameras, both featuring f/2.0 aperture. The HTC U11 Life is equipped with a front-mounted fingerprint scanner. It has a relatively small 2,600 mAh Li-Ion battery.

(79, 'Lava', 'Lava A3', 25000, 24999, 'The Indian smartphone brand Lava has been in the Nepali smartphone market for quite a while. Lava has been providing low-end mobiles and smartphones for the Nepali users. However, now Lava has been expanding its horizon and toiling to provide mid-range phones. It has recently brought a Lava A3 phone, which is packed with greater specs as compared to its previous models. And this smartphone probably is the first mid-range phone in the Lava family. This new device costs Rs. 25,000 in Nepali market. The manufacturers have claimed that the device comes with greater specs and the slogan â€˜Never miss a detailâ€™ justifies it. So, in order to dig the truth, letâ€™s explore what is inside the phone and letâ€™s find out if the phone worth the price and worth a buy.\r\n\r\nDesign \r\nLava A3 includes sleek metallic back with carefully placed and convincingly colored plastic caps on the top and bottom of the phone. Though provided with an Aluminum body, the phone is light in weight.The device is thin, which has added elegance to its design. The curved edges have eased the user to hold the device with a single hand. However, the smooth and soft finish has made the device somewhat slippery. This can, however, be avoided with the addition of skins or back cover to the device. The device also lacks capacitive touch buttons on the chin. However, the on-screen buttons will help you do the job anyway.\r\n\r\nDisplay \r\nLava A3 comes with a 5.5-inch IPS LCD display with Gorilla Glass 3 protection. The presence of Gorilla Glass has made the device secure from cracks and scratches. However, the presence of IPS LCD when the other devices are furnishing OLED, Optic AMOLED and Super AMOLED displays has made the Lava A3 somewhat obsolete. The deviceâ€™s display includes 720p (HD) resolution. As most of the devices in this price segment are available with Full HD resolution, this feature might be the reason to pull back Lava A3 in the race.\r\n\r\nHowever, this resolution slows down the battery consumption and hence provides greater battery backup. On the contrast side, the phone has low contrast ratio. The minimum brightness of the device saves you from the eyestrain. However, in the broad daylight, even with the full brightness, your eyes have to struggle to view the display. The phone comes with auto brightness option, which saves your time of frequently changing display brightness while being on indoors and outdoors. The screen drawback also includes the lack of color saturation in which the true color disguises.\r\n\r\nHardware\r\nMoving on, the device includes circular slot fingerprint scanner on the back, placed right below the camera and LED flash. Lava A3 is furnished with speaker grills on the bottom. There is a single speaker installed to the device, however, two grills are provided for the sake of symmetry. The audio quality of the device is good to the speaker and even on the earphone, however; the sound is not loud enough to struggle in a sonorific environment. The hardware also includes the power button, volume buttons and the charging slot, which is placed on the right, left and bottom of the device respectively. The volume keys and power key are well placed with a suitable distance between them providing the ease even to press them simultaneously when desired. The hardware also includes a tiny LED on the top, which physically reminds you about the notifications by blinking.', 10, 'Lava A3.jpg'),
(80, 'Sony Xperia', 'Xperia XA2', 30000, 28000, 'Stepping up in the footsteps of the XA and the XA1, the XA2 leaves the traditional 5-inch display for a 5.2-inch (500nits) panel. Along with the physical size, the XA2 also features a full HD display. The battery has also been increased to 3300mAh.\r\n\r\nIt is built on an aluminum frame with a polycarbonate back with colors ranging from silver, black, blue and even pink (nothing we havenâ€™t seen before). It offers Quick Charge 3.0, for obvious reasons as it runs on an octa-core Snapdragon 630 SoC.\r\nThe XA2 packs 3GB of RAM and 32GB of expandable storage alongside Bluetooth 5.0 (seemed like a notable feature). It also comes with Android 8.0 Oreo straight out of the box.\r\n\r\nThe phone has a fingerprint sensor on the back right below the 23MP f/2.0 aperture camera. The same camera is also capable of video recordings of up to 2160p at 30fps. At the front, it holds a 16MP+8MP camera setup. The 16MP is a f/2.0 sensor with OIS whereas the 8MP f/2.4 is a wide-angle sensor with a FOV of up to 120 degrees. Video recordings maxes out at 1080p 30fps.\r\nIt will have the usual single and dual-SIM variant, 802.11ac wifi, NFC, USB-C port and a 3.5mm headphone jack. It also has the traditional Sony style dedicated two-stage camera shutter button on the side.', 16, 'Xperia Xa2.jpg'),

Itâ€™s tagline â€œMore Bigger Battery Larger Enduranceâ€ surely justifies the real life durability as well. With normal use, I could easily squeeze two days of battery life and with heavy gaming and frequent use, it lasted me until the end of the day which is what I would generally expect from a battery of this size. The phone comes with a lot of power saving modes if you want to get more out of the massive battery.\r\n\r\nAlso, accompanying the phone is a  5V-1.5A charger which fills up the device within 2 hours 15 minutes give or take.', 19, 'zte__a2_plus.jpg'),
